# belly-button-challenge
Module 14 Challenge
In this challenge, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset: http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/
This data catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. 

Here's what I did! I used a D3 library to read in samples.json from this url: https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json

Then, I created a horizontal bar char with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that indvidual. 

Next, I created a bubble chart that displays each sample. 

I also displayed the sample metadata and each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object from somewhere on the page. 

All plots will update when a new sample is selected. 

My app is deployed using GitHub pages! Enjoy :)
